            <p>Dear Users,</p>

            <p>
                On June 29, 2020 the Govt. of India decided to block 59 apps, including TikTok. We are in the process of
                complying with the Government of India's directive and also working with
                the government to better understand the issue and explore a course of action.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ensuring the privacy and security of all our users in India remains our utmost priority.
            </p>
